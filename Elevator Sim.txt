Future Event List:
Declared as global, PriorityQueue<Event> fel.
Method createEvents() generates events and adds them to fel. (Demo.java Line 104 )
fel automatically sorts events by shortest time with an EventComparator class. (EventComparator.java)

When a "New arriving Person Event" occurs, a new customer is generated. (Demo.java Line 86)

"New arriving Person Event" is generated by the method generatePersonEvent(). (Demo.java Line 167)
Exponential distribution formula is put in the method newPersonTime().  (Demo.java Line 160)
A new person's arriving time is calculated by taking the current clock time + the number generated from newPersonTime().  (Demo.java Line 170)
